## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-21 — Security Fixes, Topic Filter & Multi-Syllabus Support

### Fixed — Backend
- `GET /api/assignments/:id` now validates student access — checks `assignTo` scope and tutor ownership before returning the assignment; students cannot fetch assignments outside their scope
- `POST /api/results` (quiz submission) now validates the student is assigned to the assignment before accepting a submission
- `GET /api/results/assignment/:id` now allows tutors to view all results for their own assignments (previously returned only the tutor's own results as if they were a student)
- `GET /api/questions` now accepts `topic` and `grade` query params for all roles (previously `grade` was admin-only and `topic` was not supported)

### Added — Frontend
- **Question bank topic filter**: selecting a subject and grade reveals a topic dropdown; only questions for that topic are shown — applies to both admin and tutor
- **Question bank grade filter**: visible for all staff; tutors default to their taught grades and cannot be shown grades outside their profile
- **Tutor grade scoping**: question bank grade selector and Add/Edit question form are pre-scoped to the tutor's taught grades; tutors cannot create or browse questions outside their assigned grades
- Visibility filter hidden from tutor view (tutors see all non-hidden questions by design)

### Changed
- Question bank page heading updated from "CAPS questions" to "questions aligned to CAPS, IEB, NSC & Cambridge" — the platform is not limited to one syllabus
- `CAPS_TOPICS` constant renamed to `TOPICS` in the frontend to reflect multi-syllabus scope
- Parent session KPI cards (Avg Score, Best Score, Pass Rate, Quizzes Done) are now hidden until the student has completed at least one quiz — prevents a confusing all-zero state
- Student dashboard empty state now links to the Question Bank so students can practise while waiting for assignments
- XP badge in the top bar is now hidden when XP is 0 (first-time students no longer see "⚡ 0 XP")

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-21 — Parent PIN Sessions, Exam Readiness Gate & Dashboard Cleanup

### Added — Backend
- `examReadinessUnlocked Boolean @default(false)` field on User model; Prisma migration `add_exam_readiness_unlock` applied
- `PATCH /students/:id/toggle-exam-readiness` endpoint (tutor/admin only); tutors restricted to their own cohort
- Analytics `student-report/:id` now returns `recommendations` array computed from topic averages: `< 50%` → urgent, `50–69%` → review, `≥ 70%` → maintain
- Analytics `student-report/:id` returns `{ locked: true }` for STUDENT callers when `examReadinessUnlocked` is false
- `PAR-XXXX` parent PIN auth: validated against `ParentAccess` table, issues JWT with `role: 'PARENT'`; no onboarding step
- `AuthPayload` extended with `'PARENT'` role in `auth.ts` middleware

### Added — Frontend
- **Parent PIN session**: entering a `PAR-XXXX` PIN on the login page authenticates directly (no role card, no onboarding)
- New **ParentSession** component (`/frontend/src/pages/ParentSession.tsx`): in-app read-only dashboard with student header, 4 KPI cards, topic performance bars, and recent quizzes list; no sidebar or navigation
- `AppShell` short-circuits for `PARENT` role and renders `ParentSession` instead of the standard layout
- **Exam readiness lock/unlock toggle** on Admin/Tutor Students page: per-student button (`🔒 Readiness` / `🔓 Readiness`); updates list in-place via API
- ExamReadiness page shows a friendly locked state when `{ locked: true }` is returned by the API
- Student Report (`/app/report/:studentId`): tutor badge added; all "Teacher Comment" labels renamed to "Tutor Comment"; footer updated to reference allocated tutor
- Student **Dashboard** cleanup: completed assignments are filtered out of the pending quiz list; "All done!" empty state with link to My Work shown when no pending work remains

### Changed
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts`: `Role` extended with `'PARENT'`; `User` interface gains `examReadinessUnlocked`, `label`, `studentId`, `daysLeft` fields
- `students` API service gains `toggleExamReadiness(id)` call

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-21 — Student Work Tracker

### Added — Frontend
- New **My Work** page for students (`/app/my-work`): full assignment tracker with filter tabs (All / Pending / Done / Overdue), subject filter, sort by due date / title / score
- Overall completion progress bar with attempt count tracking (X/max attempts used)
- Colour-coded urgency: overdue (red), due ≤2 days (amber), on-track (default)
- Best-score panel on completed assignments showing distinction/merit/pass grade and correct/total breakdown
- Retake button shows remaining attempts; disabled when exhausted
- Sidebar badge on "My Work" showing count of pending (non-overdue, not done) assignments
- Sidebar student nav reorganised: My Work as first learning item

---

- Tutor login card updated to show TCH-XXXX PIN format

- `subjects String[]` and `teachGrades Int[]` fields on User model for tutor profiles

- Analytics `/report/:id` now includes allocated tutor (`tutor: { id, name } | null`) in response
- Parent PIN `createPin` accepts `expiryDays` param (7 / 14 / 30 / 60); defaults to 7

### Added — Frontend
- Tutor onboarding modal on login: select subjects (Maths / Phys Sci) and grades (10 / 11 / 12) before account creation
- Tutor profile shows subjects + grades in Sidebar profile modal
- Admin Analytics per-student view: tutor info banner above KPI cards (name or "No tutor assigned")
- Parent PINs: 2-step modal flow — browse full student list (searchable + grade filter) → configure PIN label & expiry
- Admin Tutors page: subject + grade tags on each tutor card
- Removed duplicate "Request Students" button from Tutor My Students empty state (kept header button only)

- New `TutorRequest` Prisma model (`tutor_requests` table): tutorId, studentId, status (pending/approved/denied), optional note; unique per pair
- Migration `add_tutor_requests` applied
- New route file `/api/tutor-requests`: GET (admin: all; tutor: own), POST (tutor requests student), PATCH (admin approve/deny), DELETE (tutor cancels pending)

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-21 — PIN-Based Auth for All Roles & Seeded Admins

### Changed — Backend
- Tutors now receive a `TCH-XXXX` PIN on first registration (name-based sign-up → PIN issued, same pattern as students)
- Admin login is PIN-only (`ADM-XXXX`); no name-based admin creation via the API
- PIN detection in auth route covers all three prefixes: `SPK` (student), `TCH` (tutor), `ADM` (admin)
- `makeUniquePin` now accepts a `generator` argument — used to emit correct prefix per role
- `pinGenerator.ts`: added `generateTutorPin()` (`TCH-`) and `generateAdminPin()` (`ADM-`) exports
- Reset-pin endpoint detects target user's role and generates `TCH-` or `SPK-` prefix accordingly
- Seed updated: 3 pre-created admin accounts — Alistair Sabe (`ADM-ALIS`), Mbongeni Mncube (`ADM-MBON`), Glad Mpala (`ADM-GLAD`)
- Tutor management routes (`GET /tutors`, `PATCH /tutors/:id/toggle-active`, `PATCH /:id/assign-tutor`) remain admin-only

### Changed — Frontend
- Login page: each role card now shows its PIN format (`SPK-XXXX` / `TCH-XXXX` / `ADM-XXXX`) as a sub-label
- Tutor first sign-up shows the same PIN copy-before-continue modal as students (PIN prefixed `TCH-`)
- Admin tab accepts PIN only; entering a plain name shows a clear error directing to `ADM-XXXX`
- Letter-spacing on the login input activates for any `SPK-`, `TCH-`, or `ADM-` prefix
- Sidebar: masked PIN badge shows correct prefix per role (`ADM-••••` / `TCH-••••` / `SPK-••••`)
- Sidebar profile modal: tutors can reveal and copy their `TCH-XXXX` PIN (same as students)
- Tutors page: each teacher card shows their `TCH-XXXX` PIN (click to reveal/hide, copy button) and a Reset PIN button (admin only)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-20 — Tutor Role & Multi-Class Support

### Added — Backend

- `teacherId` field on User — links a student to their assigned tutor

- `tutorId` field on Assignment — `null` = global admin assignment; set = scoped to tutor's cohort
- `adminOrTutorOnly` middleware for routes accessible to both roles
- Auth route handles `role: 'tutor'` — find-or-create by name with TUTOR role
- `GET /api/students/tutors` — lists all tutors with their allocated students (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/students/:id/assign-tutor` — assign/unassign a student to a tutor (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/students/tutors/:id/toggle-active` — activate/deactivate a tutor

- Sidebar: role badge shows "Teacher" for TUTOR, "SuperAdmin" for ADMIN
- New page `admin/Tutors.tsx` — admin-only; list all teachers, assign/unassign students, activate/deactivate
- Students page: shows "Teacher" column for admin; heading adapts ("My Students" for tutors)
- App shell: TUTOR role shares admin pages (server-side scoping handles data isolation)
- New sidebar link "👩‍🏫 Teachers" for admin; tutors do not see this link
- `tutors` API service: `list`, `toggleActive`, `assignStudent`
